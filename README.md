# json-schema

## This project has been superseded

The project has been superseded by [json-schema2](https://gitlab.com/Gnuxie/json-schema2/)

## WIP (and currently unstable) json-schema library

What this library already can do:

* basically what json-mop does but is able to manage inheritance, so in way json-schema.mop is like a json-mop2

The aims of this library are

* using json-schemas to define clos classes
* reading json and producing instances of the schema classes
* serialization of instances back to json.
* validation of instances against the schema.
* any crazy thing to generate more from schemas someone else wrote. (original intent)

Because of the last aim, the end result will probably not be entirely spec conforming.
Any non conforming behavoir will be made clear.
