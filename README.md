# json-schema

## WIP (and currently unusable) json-schema library

The aims of this library are

* using json-schemas to define clos classes
* reading json and producing instances of the schema classes
* serialization of instances back to json.
* validation of instances against the schema.
* any crazy thing to generate more from schemas someone else wrote. (original intent)

Because of the last aim, the end result will probably not be entirely spec conforming.
Any non conforming behavoir will be made clear.
